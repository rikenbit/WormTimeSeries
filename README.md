# WormTimeSeries
- Since the neural activity patterns showed little correlation when viewed at the same time, we investigated whether there was any correlation with neural activity shifted by time Ï„.
- There are 7 analysis.
1. Time series neural activity plot (each cell)
2. Correlogram (each cell, each c.elegans)
3. Time series dimensionality reduction and clustering (each c.elegans)
4. Spectrogram (each cell)
5. Time-delay embedding (each cell)
6. Eigenvalue distribution of the history matrix of all cells (each c.elegans)
7. Recurrence plot (each cell)
